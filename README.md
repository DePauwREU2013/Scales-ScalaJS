# Example Scales application written in Scala.js

This is a barebones example of an application written in
[Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).
It has been hijacked as a test harness for developing a Scala-JS version of
the Scales library. It will go away fairly soon.

Compile with `~ ;fastOptJS ;test:fastOptJS` in `sbt`, then open
`index-fastopt.html` (and `testsuite-fastopt.html` for test results).
